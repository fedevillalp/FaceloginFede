# FACE RECOGNITION LOGIN

This app authenticates you using a picture of your face. The picture that you provide will be stored by our face recognition system and used to authenticate you the next time you come back. To log you in, we will use your current foto and compare it to the foto that we have on file.

Currently, the app works by using links to pictures. The next stepp is to add capability to get face pictures directly from the users webcam.  The same could be done for audio to use voice recognition.
